# Cyclops Plan

## High

- [x] Get coding agents involved
- [x] Remove order for notes when untangling loops
- [x] Break out Ops from Pattern
- [x] Separate function realization from merge
- [x] Figure out why timing doesn't work
- [x] Smart splat
- [x] Reduplicate
- [x] > < <> Merge
- [/] Shorter hand
  - [-] Magic n/s parsing?
  - [x] Default merge (o 1 :bd :sd :sd) (o 1 [1 2 3 4] [:supersaw]) :or (o 1 [:bd :sd :sd])
- [x] Once
- [x] Stack merge
- [x] Core Tidal/Strudel stuff
  - [x] OSC
  - [x] Cycling timer
  - [x] Event representation
  - [x] Pattern representation
  - [x] Pattern notation
  - [x] Pattern mixing
  - [x] Euc
  - [-] Splice as default for []s?
- [x] Randomized events
- [x] Mix in Overtone music namespace
- [x] Break out namespaces
- [x] Implement */
- [x] Write tests
- [x] Live cps changes
- [x] Mini notation macro/data
- [x] Data notation
- [x] Fix `slow`
- [-] Get pattern back from Cycle?
- [x] Compare op merge with Tidal/Strudel
- [ ] Fix op merge
- [ ] Complete ctrl testing
- [ ] Verify merge fns
- [ ] Try breaking out different merge modes
- [ ] Write tests
- [ ] Implement Tidal strudel stuff
- [ ] Some actual music
- [ ] scsynth startup
- [ ] Core Tidal/Strudel stuff
  - [/] Effects
  - [/] Oscillators
  - [ ] Tidal/strudel reference
- [/] Sampling synth with pitch control like superdough
- [ ] Namespace our ctrl params
- [ ] Make OSC send pluggable
- [ ] Docs and examples
- [ ] Videos
- [ ] Announce
- [ ] Present
    
## Medium High
- [ ] Get mixmatched pattern ops to work like Tidal?
  - [ ] How does it work when there are more args than vals? (rep [2 3] :a)
  - [ ] How does it work when there are more vals than args? (rep [2 3] :a :b :c)

## Medium
- [ ] Scaling sampler in Overtone
- [ ] Overdirt (Supertone?) in Overtone
- [ ] More collection mangling/specter examples
- [ ] Mini notation string
- [ ] Arps and arp pattenrs
- [ ] LLM support (LLM help docs)
- [ ] AI composition
- [ ] Audio file playback
- [ ] Text playback
- [ ] Graphics
    - [ ] Processing
    - [ ] Quil
- [ ] Separate dirt add midi/osc
- [ ] Optimize recursion
