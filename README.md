# Shhh

Implementation of TidalCycles / Strudel, but taking advantage of Clojure's lisp syntax and collection manipulation capabilities.

The `reference/` directory contains code bases for TidalCycles, Strudel (a JS variation of Tidal), and Piratidal, an alternate and incomplete Clojure implementation of Tidal.
